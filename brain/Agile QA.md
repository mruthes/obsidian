Within the agile team, the QA’s, programmers and business stakeholders all  
have an important role in software testing, as with traditional lifecycles.  
Programmers should always perform unit tests as they develop features from  
the user stories. QA’s then test those features as they become available.  
Business stakeholders also test the stories during implementation. Business  
stakeholders might use written test cases, but they also might simply  
experiment with and use the feature to provide fast feedback to the  
development team.
