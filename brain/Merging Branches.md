Once you've made changes in a branch and want to incorporate those changes into another branch (usually the main branch), you perform a merge. For example, if you're on the **feature-branch** and want to merge it into **main**:

`git checkout main

`git merge feature-branch

This will merge the changes from **feature-branch** into **main**.
