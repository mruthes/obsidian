Software Quality refers to two related but distinct notions:
- Software functional quality reflects how well it complies with or conforms to a given design based on functional requirements or specifications(1). That attribute can also be described as the fitness for the purpose of a piece of software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as a worthwhile product(2).Finally, it is the degree to which the correct software was produced.
- Software structural quality refers to how it meets non-functional requirements that support the delivery of the functional requirements, such as robustness or maintainability. It has much more to do with the degree to which the software works as needed.(3)
