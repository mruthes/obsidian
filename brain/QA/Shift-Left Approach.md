Based on the information provided, I would recommend the **Shift-Left Approach** for automation testing. Here's why:

1. **Catch errors early:** By automating testing early in the development cycle, you can catch errors and fix them before they become big problems.
2. **Improve quality:** Automation testing helps to ensure that the product or system meets the required quality standards, and by doing it early, you can catch any issues before they become critical.
3. **Reduce costs:** Fixing errors early on can save you time, money, and resources in the long run.

Additionally, automation testing is often used to:

1. **Increase test coverage:** Automation testing can cover a wider range of scenarios and test cases, increasing overall test coverage.
2. **Improve accuracy:** Automation testing can reduce human error and increase accuracy, ensuring that the product or system meets the required standards.
3. **Save time:** Automation testing can save time by automating repetitive tasks and allowing testers to focus on more complex and high-value testing activities.

However, it's essential to note that automation testing should be used in conjunction with other testing approaches, such as manual testing, to ensure that the product or system is thoroughly tested and meets the required quality standards.

In terms of the context provided, the Shift-Left Approach aligns with the benefits and risks of test automation mentioned in the ISTQB CTFL Syllabus (Context 2). By shifting testing and quality control to the left, you can reduce the risks associated with automation testing and ensure that the product or system meets the required quality standards.
