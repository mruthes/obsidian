It is a testing strategy that encompasses a sequence of different activities performed by the testing team to ensure that all features are tested and that all the project's requirements are met.

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Analyze client and stakeholder requirements from a testing perspective. Ensure all requirements are testable, decide on strategies for non-testable requirements, and assess automation feasibility.

2. **Test Planning**: Estimate resources, costs, and deadlines based on analyzed requirements.

3. **Test Development**: Create test case specifications and test scripts for manual and automated testing. Develop a requirement traceability matrix to track connections between requirements, test cases, and results.

4. **Environment Setup**: Identify environment information, hardware limitations, and software requirements. This can be done in parallel with test planning and design.

5. **Test Execution**: Execute all designed test cases, categorize results (Pass, Fail, Partly Pass, Not Executed), and make decisions based on outcomes (e.g., bug tracking, troubleshooting, re-execution).

6. **Test Cycle Closure**: Evaluate the entire testing cycle based on criteria like requirement coverage, time, resources, and quality. Analyze to improve future cycles and prepare a test closure report.
