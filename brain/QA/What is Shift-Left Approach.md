**What is Shift-Left Approach?**

Imagine you're building a house. You start by laying the foundation, then you build the walls, and finally, you add the roof and decorations. This is like a traditional approach to building a house.

In the Shift-Left Approach, you start by doing quality control (testing) before you even start building the walls. You test the foundation, the design, and even the idea before you start construction. This way, you can catch any mistakes or problems early on and avoid having to fix them later.

**Why Shift-Left?**

The term "Shift-Left" comes from the idea of shifting the testing and quality control process to the left side of the development process. Instead of waiting until the end of the process to test and fix errors, you do it earlier on. This approach helps you to:

1. **Catch errors early:** By testing earlier, you can catch errors and fix them before they become big problems.
2. **Improve quality:** By focusing on quality from the start, you can build a better product or system.
3. **Reduce costs:** Fixing errors early on can save you time, money, and resources in the long run.

**How Shift-Left Approach works:**

In the Shift-Left Approach, testing and quality control are done in parallel with the development process. Here's an example of how it might work:

1. **Design:** You start by designing the product or system.
2. **Test:** While designing, you also start testing and verifying that the design is correct.
3. **Development:** Once the design is tested and verified, you start building the product or system.
4. **Test:** While building, you continue testing and verifying that the product or system is working as expected.
5. **Deployment:** Finally, you deploy the product or system to the end-users.

By shifting testing and quality control to the left, you can catch errors early on and build a better product or system. This approach helps you to deliver high-quality products or systems faster and with fewer errors.
