  
So, before we move on to the world of agile software development and agile  
software testing let us discuss the major types of testing currently in use  
today. This is not a complete, exhaustive list and I am sure some of you will  
all know of a few other types and want to say 'what about ...' but please  
remember this book has already been written and published. Also, I cannot  
hear you but please feel free to email any suggestions for the next edition.  
However, most of the common styles are here, you will not use all of them,  
but you will come across most during your careers in IT.  
These days software QAâ€™s should have a good array of testing methods and  
tools at their disposal. These can be generally classified within the Dynamic  
and Static areas. Static testing is based on the methods used for Code  
Reviews, Walkthroughs and Inspections. Dynamic testing methods involve a  
developer or QA using the computer program or parts of it. Types can also be  
split between Black Box and White Box as detailed below.
